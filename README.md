# hello-world
I shall obtain dominion over the universe. Mua hahahaha.
I love sushi omakase style, virginia red wine, and kitty cats. I'm nice and care for humanity on a grand scale and I think everyone no matter who they are should have their basic needs met. However I strongly dislike interacting with people in uncontrolled environments where I am not sure what to expect. Although, I do enjoy interacting with people at work, restaurants (Mainly because I need to eat to survive) and at family/friend gatherings, but I hate shopping malls, churches, grocery stores, and crowded streets (I prefer online shopping from the comfort of my couch). I live for clouds, rain and snow. The best mountains are swimming in clouds and the most beautiful beaches are laced with snow. I melt in the sun. 
I am here because coding is something I want to learn. What better place to be?
